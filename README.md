# VHDL-Project
The objective of this task is to demonstrate the utilization of VHDL (Very High-Speed Integrated Circuit Hardware Description Language) in implementing a project related to pedestrian crossing. This project focuses on designing combinational and sequential digital circuits using VHDL. Additionally, the report showcases the application of a suitable VHDL compiler and simulator. It addresses real-world challenges in digital system design and highlights the utilization of an FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Arrays) development board for implementing digital logic design
